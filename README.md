## Demo

url: https://helperhub.skeptic-systems.de/

## Install

Docker

nano docker-compose.yml

copy the offical docker-compose.yml content from the repository to your local docker-compose.yml file

Adjust path and post settings

docker compose up -d

## Configuration

You can adjust the data path in the docker-compose.yml

## Additional Information

The URL is hard-coded under `/RFE/Components/Pages/Home.razor`. In the future, this will be changed dynamically using the Docker Env variable `API__URL:`, but that is beyond my knowledge. We are open to suggestions. Otherwise, you have to change the 3 API URLs in the path mentioned above and build the Docker image yourself.
